\title{Lowpass filtering of time series data}
\usage{
lpfilt(eyeris, wp = 4, ws = 8, rp = 1, rs = 35, plot_freqz = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{eyeris}{An object of class \code{eyeris} derived from \code{\link[=load]{load()}}.}

\item{wp}{The end of passband frequency in Hz (desired lowpass cutoff).}

\item{ws}{The start of stopband frequency in Hz (required lowpass cutoff).}

\item{rp}{Required maximal ripple within passband in dB.}

\item{rs}{Required minimal attenuation within stopband in dB.}

\item{plot_freqz}{Boolean flag for displaying filter frequency response.}
}
\value{
An \code{eyeris} object with a new column in \code{timeseries}:
\verb{pupil_raw_\{...\}_lpfilt}.
}
\description{
The intended use of this method is for smoothing, although by specifying
\code{wp} and \code{ws} differently one can achieve highpass or bandpass filtering
as well. However, only lowpass filtering should be done on pupillometry data.
}
\details{
This function is automatically called by \code{glassbox()} by default. If needed,
customize the parameters for \code{lpfilt} by providing a parameter list. Use
\code{glassbox(lpfilt = FALSE)} to disable this step as needed.

Users should prefer using \code{glassbox()} rather than invoking this function
directly unless they have a specific reason to customize the pipeline
manually.
}
\note{
This function is part of the \code{glassbox()} preprocessing pipeline and is not
intended for direct use in most cases. Provide parameters via
\code{lpfilt = list(...)}.

Advanced users may call it directly if needed.

demo_data <- eyelink_asc_demo_dataset()

demo_data |>
  # set lpfilt to FALSE (instead of a list of params) to skip step
  eyeris::glassbox(lpfilt = list(plot_freqz = TRUE)) |>
  plot(seed = 0)
