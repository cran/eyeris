\title{Calculate pupil speed using finite differences}
\usage{
speed(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of pupil data}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of time data}
}
\value{
A vector of pupil speeds at each time point
}
\description{
Computes the speed of pupil changes using finite differences between
consecutive time points. This is a helper function for the detransient step.
