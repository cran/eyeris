Description: Pupillometry offers a non-invasive window into the mind and has been used extensively as a psychophysiological readout of arousal signals linked with cognitive processes like attention, stress, and emotional states [Clewett et al. (2020) <doi:10.1038/s41467-020-17851-9>; Kret & Sjak-Shie (2018) <doi:10.3758/s13428-018-1075-y>; Strauch (2024) <doi:10.1016/j.tins.2024.06.002>]. Yet, despite decades of pupillometry research, many established packages and workflows to date unfortunately lack design patterns based on Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles [see Wilkinson et al. (2016) <doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18>]. 'eyeris', on the other hand, follows a design philosophy that provides users with an intuitive, modular, performant, and extensible pupillometry data preprocessing framework out-of-the-box. 'eyeris' introduces a Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)-like organization for derivative (i.e., preprocessed) pupillometry data as well as an intuitive workflow for inspecting preprocessed pupil epochs using interactive output report files [Esteban et al. (2019) <doi:10.1038/s41592-018-0235-4>; Gorgolewski et al. (2016) <doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.44>].
